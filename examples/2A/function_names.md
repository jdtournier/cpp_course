- `area()`<br>
  Too vague (area of what?), and clearly not an action.
- `A()`<br>
  Too short to be unambiguous (`A()` could mean any number of things:
  attenuation, absorption, acceleration, ...), as well as too vague and not an
  action.
- `calculation()`<br>
  Too vague (calculation of what?), and again, not an action.
- `do_calculation()`<br>
  Better in that it clearly describes an action, but still too vague.
- `get_area()`<br>
  Also better, but still ambiguous as to what area is being computed.
- `compute_area_of_triangle()`<br>
  Much better: this clearly states this is intended to perform an action, and
  is much more specific as to what area is being computed!
